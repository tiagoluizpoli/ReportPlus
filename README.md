# ReportPluss

I developed this report for my old job (as a way to get their attention). I used to work as tech support back then, and unfortunately they didn't even botter to even check it out :(

Anyways, i've learned a lot with it and even if it isn't the best of what i can do, i believe its important to showcase what i was able to do with it.


**This is a report that shows "sold products", filtered by user, group, product, day of week, plus a ton of other filter possibilities.**

## What i've learned and evolved
See below some of the skills and technologies i've had to sharpenned or learn for this project.
	

 - [x] Structred SQL queries 
 - [x] Excel Reading and Writing (with C#)
 - [x] Windows Registry management
 - [x] Lots of Windows Forms UI limitation workaround
 - [x] LINQ Queries
 - [x] Text Encrypt
 - [x] Multi Thread management

Among every other difficulties that i had to overcome to reach the main goal.
